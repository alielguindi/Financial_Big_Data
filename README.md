# Financial Markets Dynamics: High-Frequency Trading and Market Fragmentation Analysis

## Introduction

The financial markets of the 21st century have undergone profound transformations, driven by rapid advancements in technology and shifts in regulatory frameworks. This study focuses on the pivotal roles of high-frequency trading (HFT) and market fragmentation in these changes.

Using complex network analysis, we have identified patterns in the interactions among "market members," uncovering consistent behaviors of collaboration or avoidance. This research, leveraging data provided by Prof. Damien Challet for an EPFL course on Financial Big Data, spans three months in 2010. It highlights the intricate, interconnected nature of financial markets, further complexified by HFT and market fragmentation.
